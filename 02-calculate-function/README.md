# Adventure Works – CALCULATE Function

This is **Phase 2** of my Adventure Works Power BI project.  

In this phase, I worked on **modifying and creating measures** to get specific insights from the data. I focused on analyzing total revenue under different conditions, like:

- Revenue **outside the US**  
- Sales of **black road bikes**  
- Total sales generated by **Sales Managers**  

I created new measures and adjusted existing ones to reflect these scenarios, then added them to visuals in Power BI to see the results clearly. All measures are formatted properly for easy reading.

- `AdventureWorks_Calculate.pbix` – The Power BI file with all the measures I created  
- `screenshots/` – Images showing the measures in action  
- `README.md` – This summary

In this phase, I learned how to **analyze data more precisely** and make my Power BI reports more meaningful.
